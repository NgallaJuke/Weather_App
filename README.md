# Description

Hey! This app is made for beginners who wants to learn how to make a weather app using Vanilla Javascript. I myself, at the time making this app, was learning from a Udemy course made by Shaun Pelling [The Net Ninja](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja/) and got inspirated form there after doing a small version of an app like this on.

This is not the best way to do it so I will do my best to improve it time to times while keeping everthing as simple as I can !

I hope you'll like it and learn from it and make some changes to it.
